# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet
In this project we were tasked with taking in a GeoJson of all earthquakes in the united states from the USGS (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). We were to create an interactive leaflet map plotting all earthquakes based on location, and intensity. Additional pop-ups were added for additional information on each earthquake
